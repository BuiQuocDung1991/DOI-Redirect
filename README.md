This userscript adds a **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** button to Google Scholar articles and automatically redirects DOI links to **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** when clicked. It enhances your Google Scholar browsing experience by providing a direct route to access papers through SciHub.

## Features

- Adds a **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** button next to each article on Google Scholar.
- Clicking on the **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** button will open the article on **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)**.
- Automatically redirects any DOI link to **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** when clicked.

3. **Save the script**.

4. Navigate to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and start browsing. You should now see the **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** button next to each article, and DOI links will redirect you to **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)**.

## How It Works

- **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** Button: A **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)** button is added to the Google Scholar search results for each article. Clicking this button will open the article on **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)**, which allows for free access.
  
- **DOI Redirect**: All DOI links (starting with `https://doi.org/`) are modified to redirect to **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)**. When you click on a DOI link, it will automatically redirect you to the corresponding article on **[SciHub](https://www.tesble.com/)**.

## Features Overview
